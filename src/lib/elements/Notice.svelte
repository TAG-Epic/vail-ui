		This site will no longer receive any feature updates nor performance improvements.
		This is due to AEXLAB ignoring it's community (<i>cough cough competitive, cough cough wassies</i>) and making maintaining this site increasingly and excessively difficult.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fun fact: this site currently works by faking a VAIL player and bypassing the hardware ban system (we are not hardware banned). Thanks AEXLAB.
		We used to do simpler ways previously however AEXLAB blocked us from using these.
